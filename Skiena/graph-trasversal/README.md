## **3️⃣ Graph BFS & DFS Traversal**

# Graph BFS & DFS Traversal

Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) on adjacency list graphs.  
Includes optional **cycle detection for directed graphs**.

- **Source:** Custom implementation for practice and competitive programming 
- **File:** [`main.cpp`](main.cpp)
- **Usage:** Compile and run the standalone C++ program.
- **Features:**
  - BFS: explores vertices level by level.
  - DFS: explores paths deeply before backtracking.
  - Cycle detection in directed graphs using recursion stack.

**Notes:**
- Input format: number of vertices n, number of edges m, then m pairs of vertices u v, then starting vertex s.
- Can handle directed or undirected graphs by toggling the flag in the source code.
- Vertices are 0-indexed.
